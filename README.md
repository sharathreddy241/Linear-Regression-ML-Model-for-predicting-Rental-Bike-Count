# Linear Regression Machine Learning Model for predicting Rental Bike Count
This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis of Rental Bike Count and Linear Regression Machine Learning Models for predicting Rental Bike Count.
I have performed EDA for data warangling and gain insights which may help business objective.
Transformed the data using coding technique,feature manipulation, selection, Data Transformation, scaling and splitting the data into training and testing sets. 
Further, I have trained and predicted the values on Linear Regression, Randon Forest Regressor, Gradient Bossing Regressor, SVM Regressor Model and found that **Gradient Boosting Model** is performing good with low variance and good accuracy.
